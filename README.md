# Neural-Network-using-CNN-Fracture-or-not-Fracture-

Using CNN with importing servral Libraries like pandas ,matplotlib,seaborn,tensorflow,tensorflow.Sequential,os,cv2 build the model.

Using Conv2D,MaxPool2D,Flatten,Dense,Dropout this sevral layers our model learn the images.

Data from Kaggle.

In this project We try to predict the Image is Fracture or Not Fracture. 

After So much Trail and Error Got 83 % Accuracy and with prediction model can give the confidence score ( Model is Confident for the prediction is right is percentage).
